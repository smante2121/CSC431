# Developer Documentation & Code Guidelines

## 1. Project Structure

- **Frontend (Flutter):**
    - Organize code by feature, including separate folders for UI components, models, and services.
- **Backend (Firebase):**
    - Structure Cloud Functions by functionality (e.g., translation, notifications).

## 2. Coding Standards

- Follow Dart and Flutter best practices.
- Write clear, concise, and well-commented code.
- Use meaningful naming conventions for variables, functions, and classes.
- Enforce consistency with linting tools and code formatters.

## 3. Version Control & Branching

- **Repository Structure:**
    - Maintain a `main` (or `master`) branch for production-ready code.
    - Develop new features in dedicated feature branches.
    - Use pull requests for merging and self-review, even as a solo developer.
- **Commit Messages:**
    - Write descriptive commit messages that clearly explain changes and reference related issues when applicable.

## 4. Development Workflow

- **Local Development:**
    - Use Flutterâ€™s hot reload for rapid UI iteration.
    - Leverage Firebase emulators for testing backend changes.
- **Testing & Debugging:**
    - Run unit, widget, and integration tests frequently.
    - Utilize logging and debugging tools to troubleshoot issues.

## 5. Documentation & Collaboration

- Keep inline code documentation and update the project README.md with setup instructions, build commands, and deployment steps.
- Use an issue tracker (e.g., GitHub Issues) to manage tasks, bugs, and feature requests.
