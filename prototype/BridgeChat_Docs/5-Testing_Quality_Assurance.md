# Testing & Quality Assurance Plan

## 1. Testing Strategy

- **Unit Testing:**  
  Write tests for individual functions and UI components using Flutterâ€™s testing framework and Firebase Cloud Function testing tools.
- **Integration Testing:**  
  Ensure smooth interaction between the Flutter front-end and Firebase back-end services.
- **End-to-End Testing:**  
  Simulate real user flows (registration, messaging, translation) to validate overall functionality.
- **Manual Testing:**  
  Perform exploratory testing to check UI responsiveness and user experience.

## 2. Test Cases (Examples)

- **User Registration/Login:**  
  Validate successful user sign-up and authentication.
- **Real-Time Messaging:**  
  Verify that messages are delivered instantly between users.
- **Translation Feature:**  
  Test that messages are correctly translated according to user preferences.
- **Error Handling:**  
  Simulate network/API failures and confirm that the system degrades gracefully.

## 3. Tools & Frameworks

- **Flutter Testing Framework:** For unit and widget tests.
- **Firebase Test Lab:** For running integration tests across different devices.
- **Manual Test Scripts:** Checklists for UI and usability testing.

## 4. Acceptance Criteria

- All core features function without critical errors.
- Message translation occurs within acceptable latency.
- The application maintains performance standards under load.
