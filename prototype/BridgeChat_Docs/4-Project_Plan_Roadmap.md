# Project Plan & Roadmap

## 1. Project Phases

- **Phase 1: MVP Development**
    - Implement core features: user registration, real-time messaging, basic translation integration.
    - Set up Firebase backend and build the initial Flutter web interface.
- **Phase 2: Feature Enhancement**
    - Improve translation accuracy and add advanced language options.
    - Implement additional features like notifications and enhanced chat history.
- **Phase 3: Cross-Platform Expansion**
    - Optimize and adapt the web application for mobile (iOS/Android) and desktop (Windows/MacOS).

## 3. Task Breakdown (Example)

- **Week 1:** Finalize documentation and set up the project repository.
- **Weeks 2-7:** Implement core functionality (registration, messaging, translation).
- **Weeks 8-9:** Conduct testing, gather feedback, and iterate.
- **Weeks 10-14:** Add advanced features and begin cross-platform development.

## 4. Risk Management

- **API Limitations:** Monitor translation API usage; plan for alternatives if limits are exceeded.
- **Performance:** Continuously test real-time performance; optimize Firebase functions and data queries.
- **Time Constraints:** Adjust timelines using agile sprints to manage scope and deliverables effectively.
